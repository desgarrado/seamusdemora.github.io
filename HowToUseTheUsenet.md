### How to get stuff from Usenet?

#### It's easy; you should need three things:

1. Get an account with a Usenet provider. [Eweka](https://www.eweka.nl/en) is one such provider. 
2. Install [SABnzbd](https://sabnzbd.org/). Virtually all platforms are supported (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc). A Linux VM may be a reasonable choice of platform.
3. An NZB search engine to find stuff to download. [The NZBindex website](https://donotlink.it/Rp0Y) is a free one. 

  You should also [read this article](https://www.howtogeek.com/71315/the-how-to-geek-guide-to-getting-started-with-usenet/) from the folks at HTG.

#### Miscellany & Afterthoughts:

- The [NZBindex website](https://donotlink.it/Rp0Y) provides no support or instruction, so you'll have to explore to find what you want. IMHO, the *search box* isn't particularly useful by itself. You may want to try narrowing down the list of Usenet groups you search over. Their names are descriptive; a.b.xxx = alt.binary.xxx, where xxx is a subject in which you might be interested.
- The [HTG article](https://www.howtogeek.com/71315/the-how-to-geek-guide-to-getting-started-with-usenet/) lists a few alternatives to the [NZBindex website](https://donotlink.it/Rp0Y). At this writing, they are pay-for-service sites. 
- If you have a good Usenet provider, and you're using SABnzbd, you really only need to focus on the `NZB Search Engine`. It's difficult to overstate its importance in terms of efficiency and results. The Usenet is a huge space, and there is a lot of junk in that space. [This article lists, ranks & discusses several NZB Usenet search engines.](https://greycoder.com/the-best-nzb-search-engine/)
